# About

<img class="kitty" src="/assets/images/cat.jpeg">

Hiya! I'm Mark, and I'm a PhD student at the Functional Programming Lab, in the School of Computer Science, at the University of Nottingham.
Before that I completed my undergrad and master's degree in mathematics and computer science at the University of Oxford. 

I'm interested in a wide variety of topics in mathematics, computer science and philosophy. 
In my research I work with homotopy type theory and use it to study different axiomatic foundations for doing geometry.
These include [synthetic differential geometry](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+differential+geometry) and [synthetic algebraic geometry](https://github.com/felixwellen/synthetic-zariski).

Recently I've been reading ``Vicious Circles'' by Jon Barwise and Lawrence Moss, about non-wellfounded set theory with applications in both computer science and philosophy. I am learning to crochet and knit too, including some mathematical crochet, like [hyperbolic surfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtlDND7NVp8), and I also listen to and review music.

I'm always available to chat about my work and interests, so feel free to contact me!
