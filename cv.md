# Mark Damuni Williams


## Education

### Computer Science PhD (2023-present)
<p style="color: #444; text-indent: 20px;"> (University of Nottingham) </p> 
- Working on Grothendieck topologies and synthetic mathematics internal to homotopy type theory.
- Supervised by [Ulrik Buchholtz](https://ulrikbuchholtz.dk/).

### MMath Mathematics and Computer Science (2019-2023)
<p style="color: #444; text-indent: 20px;"> (University of Oxford) </p> 
- Dissertation: [Modalities and Geometry in Homotopy Type Theory](/assets/docs/ModalitiesAndGeometryInHoTT.pdf). 
    - Supervised by Kobi Kremnitzer.
    - Thesis reviews the use of modalities to encode generic geometric structures in type theory, in particular, tangent spaces and bundles, derivatives and étale maps. Then I investigate an open problem regarding classifying the étale maps for nullification of a single type.
- Awarded the Hoare Prize 2023 for the best overall performance in mathematics and computer science.

## Talks 
- A Recipe for Synthetic Mathematics in HoTT (MGS 2024)
